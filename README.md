# Setup

The following was used:

```ruby
rails new lynch-the-witch --skip-action-mailer --skip-action-mailbox --skip-active-storage --skip-sprockets --skip-turbolinks --webpack=vue
```

I've been trying to experiment with stripping Rails down to the bare essentials as much as possible.

# Database

Currently using Sqlite.
